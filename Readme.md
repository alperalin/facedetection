## Face Detection And Censor Example

This is from wesbos's javascript beginner course

## Run Server

`npm start`

**Note:** This API is still experimental and under development. It isn’t available right off the bat in Chrome. From my experience some operating systems still don’t detect very well (my Linux machine can’t detect anything, my Windows machine only detects faces and my Apple machines detect face, eyes and mouth).

To put it available you must first enable **Experimental Web Platform Features** on your Chrome’s flags. Very simple to do.

Go to :
`chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

And **enable** the **Experimental Web Platform features** section.
